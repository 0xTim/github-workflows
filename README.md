# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository will contain reusable workflows to minimize redundant workflows across the organization. This effort will also facilitate the standardization of testing processes while empowering repository code owners to customize their testing plans as needed. The repository will contain workflows to support different types of repositories, such as Swift Package and Swift Compiler.

For more details on reusable workflows, please refer to the [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) section in the GitHub Docs.
